# RSI Account Verification

Linking your RSI account to Citizen iD confirms your identity within the Star Citizen® community and unlocks verification-based features across connected tools and Discord servers.
This process is straightforward and ensures that your Citizen iD reflects your in-game identity.

From your Citizen iD dashboard, locate the **RSI Account** section.
If you have not yet verified, its status will be shown as **Pending**, along with a **Verify Now** button.
Clicking this begins the verification process.

The verification flow consists of three simple steps:
1. providing your RSI username,
2. making a temporary profile change,
3. and confirming your link.

In the first step, you’ll be asked to enter your RSI handle exactly as it appears on your RSI Account Dashboard.
You can find this by logging into the RSI website and checking the left-hand side of your profile page, beneath your avatar and community moniker.

Once the steps are completed, Citizen iD will verify ownership of the RSI account.
When successful, your RSI Account section will display a green **Verified** badge along with your RSI handle.
Your profile will also gain the **Verified** role, which community tools and Discord servers can use to grant you special access (semi-)automatically.

Completing RSI verification only needs to be done once, but you can remove it at any time if needed.
