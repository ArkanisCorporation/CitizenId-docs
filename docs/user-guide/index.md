# What is Citizen iD?

Citizen iD is a secure, centralised authentication system built for the Star Citizen community.
It provides you with a single, verified identity that works across participating community tools, Discord servers, and partner services.
By verifying your RSI account once, you can reuse that verification wherever it’s needed, without repeating the process for each new service.

Beyond verification, Citizen iD simplifies access by offering single sign-on.
With one account, you can log into multiple tools instantly, while keeping full control over which services can access your data.
If you change your mind, you can revoke access at any time from your dashboard.

The system is designed for both convenience and security.
It uses modern authentication standards such as OAuth 2.0 to protect your information, while also streamlining community integration.
Many Star Citizen projects require RSI verification, and Citizen iD ensures you only need to complete it once.

In practice, Citizen iD saves time and effort.
For example, when you join a new Star Citizen community Discord server, you no longer need to provide screenshots or manually confirm your RSI status.
Instead, you authorise the server through Citizen iD, and your roles are assigned automatically within seconds.

tl;dr with Citizen iD, you can:

* **Verify your RSI account** <u>once and reuse</u> that verification across multiple projects.
* **Sign in with a single click** using our <u>Single Sign-On</u> (SSO) feature.
* **Manage permissions** for which apps, servers, or services can access your data.
* **Link Discord roles** (semi-)automatically based on your verified status.
* **Revoke access anytime** from a central dashboard.

## Why use Citizen iD?

* **Convenience**
  <br>No more juggling logins across different tools.

  <br>Built with modern authentication standards, including **OAuth 2.0**.
