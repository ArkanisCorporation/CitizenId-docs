# RSI Verification Withdrawal

If you no longer wish to have your RSI account linked to Citizen iD, you can withdraw your verification at any time.
This will remove the verified status from your profile and may limit access to community tools or Discord roles that depend on RSI verification.

To begin, go to your Citizen iD dashboard and locate the **RSI Account** section.
If your account is currently verified, you will see a green **Verified** badge alongside your RSI handle.
Open the options menu for this section and select the option to remove or withdraw verification.

Once confirmed, your RSI account link will be removed immediately.
Any connected services that relied on your verified status—such as Discord Linked Roles—will automatically revoke the associated roles or permissions.
This ensures that verification-sensitive features remain secure and up to date.

You can reverify at any time by repeating the original [RSI Account Verification](./rsi-verification.md) process.

## Automated Withdrawal When Changing Your RSI Handle

Citizen iD automatically monitors your RSI account handle for changes.
If your handle no longer matches the one used during verification, the system will automatically withdraw your verification.
This prevents impersonation and ensures the linked account remains authentic.

If this occurs, your verified status will be removed and any features, roles, or permissions depending on it will be automatically revoked.
To restore verification, simply repeat the verification process using your new RSI handle.
Doing so will immediately reinstate your verified status and restore access to verification-based features.
