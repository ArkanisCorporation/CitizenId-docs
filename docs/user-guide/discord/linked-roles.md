# Linked Roles

Citizen iD supports Discord’s <a href="https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/10388356626711-Connections-Linked-Roles-Admins" target="_blank">Linked Roles</a> feature, allowing users to easily claim application-linked roles on any server.
Individual roles may have requirements based on your RSI account verification status, RSI account age and other linked data.
This integration removes the need for manual role management and ensures access is always in sync with your verification status.

To claim a linked role, start by navigating to the server’s menu in Discord and selecting **Linked Roles**.

You’ll see a list of available Linked Roles, along with the application icons.
Select the appropriate role which has the Citizen iD application icon to begin the connection process.

Discord may display a prompt to connect your Citizen iD account.
This step verifies that your account meets the role requirements—for example, having a verified RSI profile that is at least a certain number of days old.
Once verified, click **Finish** to complete the process.

When the link is successful, the corresponding role will be immediately to your Discord account for that server.
