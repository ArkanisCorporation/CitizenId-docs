# Creating Your Account

To start using Citizen iD, you first need to create an account. This process is quick and uses your existing Discord account for authentication. By signing in with Discord, you skip the need for separate usernames and passwords while ensuring a secure, verified connection to the Citizen iD platform.

When you visit the Citizen iD sign-in page, you’ll be greeted with a welcome message outlining the platform’s mission: to unify the Star Citizen® identity ecosystem with ease of use, security, and accessibility in mind. You begin by clicking the **Sign in with Discord** button.

This will open a Discord authorisation window, where you’ll be asked to grant Citizen iD access to basic account information, such as your username, avatar, and email address, as well as information about the servers you’re in. This information is necessary for features like Discord Linked Roles and community integration. Once you review the permissions, click **Authorize** to continue.

After authorisation, you’ll be taken to your Citizen iD account dashboard. Here you can see your profile, account standing, roles, and a list of authorised applications. If you haven’t yet linked your RSI account, you’ll see a **Pending** status with an option to verify. At this stage, your Citizen iD account is ready for use, though certain features will remain locked until RSI verification is complete.

Creating your account in this way ensures a secure and streamlined experience, letting you immediately integrate with community tools while keeping control over your data.
