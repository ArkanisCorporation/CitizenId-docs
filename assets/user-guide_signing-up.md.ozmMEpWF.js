This information is necessary for features like Discord Linked Roles and community integration. Once you review the permissions, click <strong>Authorize</strong> to continue. <img src="'+r+'" alt="Discord authorisation screen"></p><p>After authorisation, you’ll be taken to your Citizen iD account dashboard. Here you can see your profile, account standing, roles, and a list of authorised applications. If you haven’t yet linked your RSI account, you’ll see a <strong>Pending</strong> status with an option to verify. At this stage, your Citizen iD account is ready for use, though certain features will remain locked until RSI verification is complete. <img src="'+e+'" alt="Citizen iD dashboard"></p><p>Creating your account in this way ensures a secure and streamlined experience, letting you immediately integrate with community tools while keeping control over your data.</p><hr><p><em>Last updated: August 2025</em></p>',8)]))}const _=t(c,[["render",u]]);export{f as __pageData,_ as default};
